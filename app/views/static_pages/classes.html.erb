					The basic Certificate course conducted at all the branches. In this a student learns the basics of Bharat Natyam and acquires a minimum quality level of a dancer. It is aimed more at creating appreciation and giving sound knowledge base of dance. As part of the training every student performs annually on stage and thus gains confidence at personal level. Here the concentration is on perfecting the technique.
